A Java Swing application that converts Transport Stream (.ts) files into .mp4 files.

# How To Run

# Known Issues
- The feature intended to install FFmpeg for the user does not work on Windows to my knowledge
  - This issue likely extends to Linux/macOS, but I have not tested that yet.

This issue can be resolved by [manually installing the FFmpeg binary (.exe) files](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)
